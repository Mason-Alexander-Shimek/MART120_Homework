GUI stands for graphical user interface, and most of us already use those sorts of things every day. Its a visual layout of buttons, drag and drops, and related menus that most people call their computer desktop, or a website the average person can navigate like Wikipedia and google and so forth. CLIs are what are used to create those sorts of GUI, and look a lot less flashy (unless you are looking at a completed one that is running in which cast it looks pretty cool in my opinion), usually consisting of a black or white void with a small area at the bottom to input text. We use many different GUIs in everyday life, but we use as many as we do because each one individually is limited in its capability that whoever designed said GUI to only be capable of performing. Because of this, CLI is a lot more powerful than GUI in terms of doing this via technology, if you are capable of understanding the various languages it uses, and it is because most people are not capable of this, that GUIs are more widely used. As an aspiring coder taking a creative coding class, the intent is that I will become more familiar with CLIs as the semester progresses.
