I'm inclined to agree with the inefficiency of learning styles. They can help a person to figure out their preferences, but any old personality test can have the same end result. I've always felt that the most efficient methods of teaching have been diverse ones where you engage multiple senses, since not only does that help guarantee that someone is going to learn something from a course, but it helps people discover what their preferences and eventually career goals are. And even then, there's ways a learn-ee's motivation, prior knowledge, and study strategies to contend with. Its a sort of "If it ain't broke don't fix it" situation. We had the optimal strategy figured out, we walked slightly backwards in trying to further optimize it.
