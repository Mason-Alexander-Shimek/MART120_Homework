I think the thing that resonated with most everyone in this class from the lecture is the same, which is just Randy's sheer optimism in face of the inevitable. Its a lot healthier to focus on the gratitude legacy, and the joy of life rather then the bad that was coming. He say it best himself: "I don't know how not to have fun. I'm dying and I'm having fun, and I'm going to keep having fun every day i have left, cause' there's no other way to play it." and I think that its because of that mindset he had that he was able to live past that initial three month diagnoses he got in 2006 all the way into 2008. Trying to achieve ones dreams for the sake of other has always been an interesting dilemma for me. You could go on to be successful and famous in your life, and then say that you do it fort he fans, but what if your not special and you never will be, does that ruin the whole gig for a lot of people? How much of your need to create is rooted in your need for people to like you versus pushing the medium and the quality of what the world is doing in a good direction? Randy of course provided his answer as solidly as he did his allyship to tigger in being someone who does it for others, but the answer always tends to vary. 

Personally, I think that focusing on that dilemma ruins things for yourself. I think its okay for someone to create something because they want attention, because if you just accept that you'll always give and never get anything, then there's no incentive to strive for anything, which feels selfish, but if rewards weren't effective motivators for us to achieve our dreams they wouldn't be as popular. The key difference, I think is that we should be just as invested in the journey as we are in the destination. There's value to find in the people we meet, the failures we learn form, and legacy we leave from our pursuits should be just as valuable to us as what we are trying to get through them.
