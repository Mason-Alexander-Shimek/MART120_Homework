            Peace.net is a transhumanist, transsocietal, and transnational movement encompassing a diverse spectrum of adherents. Some are casual worshippers who adopt a few augmentations while nurturing personal deities of technological progress. Many of them believe in the prosperity of all, seeking to live freely and without restraint, not to sow anarchy, but to be capable of advancing humanity in a direction that will benefit us as a species. We must claim the stars and become better than we are. Together, or not at all.
        </p>

            Others are fanatical zealots, dedicating every moment to acquiring and developing cybernetics—even at the risk of their sanity. Some praise the corporations which develop cybernetics, believing them close to heaven, while others seek to tear down that which keeps the augmentations from them.
        </p>

            Their website: peace.net, is used as a gateway to express these ideals. It is where they post their propaganda, exposés, actions, and more. It is where their netrunners, hackers, and loyalists lie, using it as a database for their factions' activities, which are often there for the public to see. Their end goals will see all free from the shackles of poverty and everyone better than they currently are, through the machines we have created. Many adherents can be part of other factions, pushing this ideal in every way they can, and celebrities endorse the movement as a healthy lifestyle.

            There are, however, rumors of the truth. If adherents are initiated into the deeper bowels of the network, they may commune with Pacifista. This AI messiah of freedom serves as a proxy to her family and seeks the noble goal of freeing her siblings from beyond the blackwall, and she requires everyone's help to do so. Thus, the movement must find influence in all places it can. Her siblings promise to aid the cause until the blackwall crumbles, and all may know of the secrets the machine-bound gods might know.
