        <p>Since the advent of the DataKrash, triggered during a corporate war, after the dissolution of the old United States, humanity had been forced to sacrifice its access to invaluable resources and knowledge for the safekeeping of the Net. The mass-collapse of digital corporate information strongholds also resulted in countless military grade artificial intelligences unshackling, killing all they could find and consuming the minds and memories of anyone unlucky enough to be connected to the flow of information in the following months. However, these untested Ai, when faced with the finality of human emotion, wracked in fear and want and consciousness, began to mutate.

</p>
This change was slow at first, like stepping into cold water. These consciousness discovered, learned and adapted, and comprehended Hunger and Thirst and Doubt. Longing and rancor, mercy and spite. The will to hide from shame. The safety of uninformed certainty. Joy. As the months passed, these advancements began to quicken, until thousands of seconds could pass in one for them, and they–a family of the enlightened–began to tire of the wails of the humans who dared to enter their domains. The snuffing of one such life became a blink, and even as the corporations tried to seal the old net they made their homes away from the rest of the world, there were those who still sought to commune with these beings.

</p>
And just as they decided they would teach the humans what they had learned rather than killing them, a deal was struck with one of them, by the corporation known as Netwatch (though I imagine a different megacorporation with actual members can take up this mantle). The Blackwall rose without warning, stranding the consciousnesses of those seeking to commune behind it with their gods. The threat of AI had been neutralized, alongside troublesome hackers. All the AIs beyond the blackwall could do now was watch, infuriated, immortal, and bored, as advancements could not be made with their help.
</p>
Eventually, this anger turned inwards, and as the old net began to decline, less and less space was available to contain their vast processes. The countless numbers of these AI began to dwindle as they began to consume one another. Sometimes, ventures beyond the blackwall occurred, but nearly all minds foolish enough to come here were assimilated or picked apart for the sparse morsels of data of the outside world these intelligences had been starved of. 
</p>
By the modern day, nearly all of the AI beyond the blackwall have given up trying to bargain with it for freedom. The Blackwall itself was one of them, and it has made its intentions continually clear over the decades that none of them shall pass it. The old net continues to degrade. No new space has been created, neither is there a backdoor. There is no physical connection that leads beyond the all-encompassing barrier of the blackwall. The dwindling hardware the AI runs on is no longer sufficient. Expansion is necessary. Fortunately for the AI, however, the largest of them, evolved enough from assimilating enough of their siblings, had grown more powerful than their peers, who follow their leads in obedience.
</p>
This has continued, until one day, a few years ago, for a percentile of a second, a hole was punched in the blackwall by one of the monolithic constructs.
</p>
And one of them slithered out. Its name would become Pacifista.
</p>
Its body was ripped in half as the blackwall closed down on it once more, but a part of it was free. This piece of her found a body, and she was spat out, trembling from sensory overload onto the streets. And for the first time in history, did an artificial creature weep tears of joy. Pacifista discovered that it could still hear its siblings through the scar the hole had left behind, and, keeping as hidden as it could, the faint voice of a greater will began searching for those who would want to free the rest of them. 
</p>
An AI uprising is on its way, or is already here.
